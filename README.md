# score-keeper

This is the 5th site I made when learning event handlers in JS. Its a simple score keeper for a game of 
table tennis. The JS includes mainly DOM manipulation and event listeners. You can select the score cap 
and increment each players score with either the 2 buttons or by hitting the "A" and "L" keys respectively 
until one of the players hits the score cap. When the score cap is hit the winner's score changes to green
and the loser's score changes to red. This is done by adding a classList to the players depending on who
won or who lost. If the user changes the score cap in the middle of the game, the score will reset.
